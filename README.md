## Requirements

Refer documentation ([this](https://core.vmware.com/resource/vsphere-vmotion-notifications) and [this](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-esxi-management/GUID-0540DF43-9963-4AF9-A4DB-254414DC00DA.html#how-to-configure-a-virtual-machine-for-vsphere-vmotion-notifications-3)) for details.

- vSphere **8.0** or later
- Virtual Hardware Version **20** or later
- VMware Tools (or Open VM Tools ) **11.0** or later

## Enable vSphere vMotion Notifications using helper script

To enable vSphere vMotion Notifications, **both VM and Host have to be configured**. This will be done by following three steps.

1. **Per Host**: Configure default timeout value for all hosts where VMs may run on by vMotion (`VmOpNotificationToApp.Timeout`).
1. **Per VM**: Enable vSphere vMotion Notifications per VM (`vmOpNotificationToAppEnabled`).
1. **Per VM**: Configure timeout value per VM (`vmOpNotificationTimeout`).

This repository includes helper script to modify these configurations.

### Initial setup for helper script

```bash
# Prepare Python environment
pip install -r helper/requirements.txt

# Prepare environment variables
export VMWARE_HOST="vcsa.example.com"
export VMWARE_USER="vmotion@vsphere.local"
export VMWARE_VALIDATE_CERTS="false"  # If required
read -sp "Password: " VMWARE_PASSWORD; export VMWARE_PASSWORD
```

### Per host settings

Modifying timeout value for **all hosts** where VMs may be running on by vMotion appears to be required, since the default timeout value is displayed as `1800` but **the actual default value is `0`**, and the smaller timeout value of the host and VM will be used to make vMotion delayed.

```bash
# Show current configuration for specific host
python helper/vmotion_notifications.py host <HOST_NAME>

# Modify timeout for vMotion Notifications for specific host (VmOpNotificationToApp.Timeout = <VALUE>), e.g. 600
python helper/vmotion_notifications.py host <HOST_NAME> --timeout <VALUE>
```

### Per VM settings

vSphere vMotion Notifications has to be enabled per VM. If timeout value is configured for VM, the smaller timeout value of the host and VM will be used to make vMotion delayed.

```bash
# Show current configuration (can NOT gather vmOpNotificationTimeout)
python helper/vmotion_notifications.py vm <VM_NAME>

# Enable vMotion Notification (vmOpNotificationToAppEnabled = true)
python helper/vmotion_notifications.py vm <VM_NAME> --enable

# Disable vMotion Notification (vmOpNotificationToAppEnabled = false)
python helper/vmotion_notifications.py vm <VM_NAME> --disable

# Modify timeout for vMotion Notification (vmOpNotificationTimeout = <VALUE>), e.g. 120
python helper/vmotion_notifications.py vm <VM_NAME> --timeout <VALUE>
```

## How to handle notifications in guest OS

Applications can use `vmtoolsd` (command line utility that installed with VMware Tools or Open VM Tools) to handle notifications.

Initially applications have to get `uniqueToken` by registering applications.

```bash
# Register your applications for notifications
# Note that uniqueToken generated by this command is important to handle notifications and is only displayed at this time
$ vmtoolsd --cmd 'vm-operation-notification.register {"appName": "demo", "notificationTypes": ["sla-miss"]}'
{"version":"1.0.0", "result": true, "guaranteed": true, "uniqueToken": "525b5364-6caf-24a0-562c-87955647baa4", "notificationTimeoutInSec": 120 }

# List registered application
$ vmtoolsd --cmd 'vm-operation-notification.list'
{"version":"1.0.0", "result": true, "info": [     {"appName": "demo", "notificationTypes": ["sla-miss"]}] }

# Unregister your applications for notifications
$ vmtoolsd --cmd 'vm-operation-notification.unregister {"uniqueToken": "525b5364-6caf-24a0-562c-87955647baa4"}'
{"version":"1.0.0", "result": true }
```

Then applications can check if your application is notified by following command. This command should be invoked periodically.

```bash
# Check if your application is notified
$ vmtoolsd --cmd 'vm-operation-notification.check-for-event {"uniqueToken": "525b5364-6caf-24a0-562c-87955647baa4"}'
```

Applications can get following events by above command. Note that only one event appears to be able to be retrieved in a single command execution, even if multiple events are queued.

The `start` event is the notification that applications should start preparing for vMotion, and `end` event is the notification that applications can be in production again.

```bash
# If your application IS NOT notified
{"version":"1.0.0", "result": true }

# If your application IS notified; vMotion started
# Note that operationId included in the output will be used to acknowledge this notification in later step
{"version":"1.0.0", "result": true, "eventType": "start",  "opType": "host-migration", "eventGenTimeInSec": 1666730185, "notificationTimeoutInSec": 120, "destNotificationTimeoutInSec": 120, "notificationTypes": ["sla-miss"],  "operationId": 6279072692702276663 }

# If your application IS notified; vMotion finished
{"version":"1.0.0",  "result": true, "eventType": "end",  "opType": "host-migration", "opStatus": "success", "eventGenTimeInSec": 1666730200, "notificationTypes": ["sla-miss"],  "operationId": 6279072692702276663 }

# Notification that just to inform the value for timeout has been updated
{"version":"1.0.0",  "result": true, "eventType": "timeout-change",  "eventGenTimeInSec": 1666736715, "notificationTimeoutInSec": 120, "newNotificationTimeoutInSec": 60, "notificationTypes": ["sla-miss"],  "operationId": 1666736715415723 }
```

Applications should notify by `ack-event` when they are ready for vMotion. This will actually start the migration.

```bash
# Acknowledge the notification
$ vmtoolsd --cmd 'vm-operation-notification.ack-event {"operationId": 6279072692702276663, "uniqueToken": "525b5364-6caf-24a0-562c-87955647baa4"}'
{"version":"1.0.0", "result": true, "operationId": 6279072692702276663,  "ackStatus": "ack_received" }
```

After the start event, if the timeout elapses, the migration is forced to start even if `ack-event` is not invoked. Therefore note that there is no way to completely abort the migration from applications side.

## Example implementation for vSphere vMotion Notifications for PoC

This repository includes example script [`examples/handle_notifications.py`](examples/handle_notifications.py) for PoC purpose to work with vSphere vMotion Notifications. The script will do;

- Register your application with specified name (`--name` or `-n` option)
- Monitor notifications at specified interval seconds (`--interval` or `-i` option, defaults to 30 seconds)
- On `start` event, invoke specified command to quiesce application (`--quiesce` or `-q` option)
- On `end` event, invoke specified command to unquiesce application (`--unquiesce` or `-u` option)
- Unregister your application on exit
- Save detailed debug log as `handle_notifications.log` in the same directory as `handle_notifications.py`

To run this script, use following syntax.

```bash
$ python3 handle_notifications.py \
  --name <APPLICATION_NAME> \
  --interval <INTERVAL_SECONDS> \
  --quiesce <QUIESCE_COMMAND> \
  --unquiesce <UNQUIESCE_COMMAND>

# Example: Use bash-based command to quiesce/unquiesce application.
## If your application does not require complex handling to quiesce/unquiesce,
## the commands to do that can be specified directly.
$ python3 handle_notifications.py --name demo --interval 10 \
  --quiesce "bash -c 'echo quiescing; sleep 10; echo quiesced'" \
  --unquiesce "bash -c 'echo unquiescing; sleep 10; echo unquiesced'"

# Example: Use external script to quiesce/unquiesce application.
## If your application require complex handling to quiesce/unquiesce,
## creating script to do that and calling that is good way.
## This repository includes `demo.sh` that just `echo` and `sleep`.
$ python3 handle_notifications.py --name demo --interval 10 \
  --quiesce "${PWD}/demo.sh -m quiesce" \
  --unquiesce "${PWD}/demo.sh -m unquiesce"
```

An actual example is as follows:

```bash
$ python3 handle_notifications.py --name demo --interval 10 \
>   --quiesce "${PWD}/demo.sh -m quiesce" \
>   --unquiesce "${PWD}/demo.sh -m unquiesce"
